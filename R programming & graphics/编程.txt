==== garbage collection ====

gc(verbose,reset)

A call of gc causes a garbage collection to take place. This will also take place automatically without user intervention

the primary purpose of calling gc is for the report on memory usage. However, it can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system

reset

logical; if TRUE the values for maximum space used are reset to the current values
