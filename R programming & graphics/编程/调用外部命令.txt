Not all Windows executables properly respect redirection of output, or may only do so from a console application such as Rterm and not from Rgui

it cannot be assumed that redirection or piping will work in system (redirection sometimes does, but we have seen cases where it stopped working after a Windows security patch), and system2 (or shell) must be used on Windows

shell is a more user-friendly wrapper for system under windows. cmd.exe is the shell on windows. there is no shell function on Unix.
