Compiling CoffedScript to JavaScript requries a JavaScript runtime and the absence of a runtime will give you and ''execjs'' error. 

MacOX and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed. 

Rails adds the **therubyracer**'' gem to Gemfile ''in a commented line for new apps and you can uncomment if you need it.

或者安装 node.js javascript 引擎。
