You can use view_context in your controller when doing 'view' tasks like generating links. The good thing about it is you don't have to include the view helpers in your controller.

e.g. in your controller you can create a variable which will be a html link with link_to or url_for if you just want the link, 'only_path' option set to false should give you absolute url. 

''view_context.url_for(:action => 'login', :controller => 'members', :only_path => false)''
