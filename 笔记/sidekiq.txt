queue 队列
threads 线程, concurrency

队列可被视为是任务的分组。可能在任何一个 thread 里处理。一个 thread 可能处理所有队列里的任务。只是检查(获取新任务)频率不同。

Don't set the concurrency higher than 50. I've seen stability issues with concurrency of 100。

ActiveRecord has a connection pool which needs to be properly configured in config/database.yml to work well with heavy concurrency. Set the pool setting to something **close or equal to** the number of threads

否则可能没有足够的连接可用。
